## Features

- Randomly generates a new Sudoku puzzle each time the game starts.
- Allows the user to make moves by entering the row, column, and number.
- Validates user moves to ensure they follow Sudoku rules.
- Provides an option to solve the puzzle if the user is stuck.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-game.git
   cd sudoku-game
```
2. Run the game:
python sudoku.py

3.Follow the prompts to play the game:
- Enter the row, column, and number to make a move (e.g., 3 4 5 to place a 5 in row 3, column 4).
- Enter 0 0 0 to solve the puzzle automatically.
```
## Code Explanation

### Printing the Board
The print_board function prints the current state of the Sudoku board in a readable format, with separators for the 3x3 boxes.

### Checking Validity
The is_valid function checks if a given number can be placed in a specified position without violating Sudoku rules (no duplicates in the same row, column, or 3x3 box).

### Solving the Puzzle
The solve function uses a backtracking algorithm to fill in the Sudoku board. It tries each number from 1 to 9 in each empty cell and recurses to solve the board. If it finds a valid solution, it returns True; otherwise, it backtracks and tries another number.

### Generating a Puzzle
The generate function creates a complete Sudoku board and then removes a random number of cells (between MIN_NUM_TO_REMOVE and MAX_NUM_TO_REMOVE) to create a puzzle. The difficulty of the puzzle can be adjusted by changing these constants.
